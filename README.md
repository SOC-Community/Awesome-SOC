# Awesome SOC
A collection of sources of documentation, and field best practices, to build and run a SOC (including CSIRT).

Those are my view, based on my own experience as SOC/CSIRT analyst and team manager, as well as well-known papers. Focus is more on SOC than on CERT/CSIRT.

NB: Generally speaking, SOC here refers to detection activity, and CERT/CSIRT to incident response activity. CERT is a well-known (formerly) US trademark, run by [CERT-CC](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), but I prefer the term CSIRT.

# Fundamental concepts

## Concepts, tools, missions, attack lifecycle, red/blue/purple teams
See: [SOC/CSIRT Basic and fundamental concepts](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/soc_basics.md).

## SOC and CSIRT core

### From logs to alerts: global generic workflow

Quoted from [this article](https://www.managedsentinel.com/siem-traditional-vs-cloud/):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/206025151-759a0040-365e-4145-aa88-f7a7b737f8be.png)

Following the arrows, we go from log data sources to data management layer, to then data enrichment layer (where detection happens), to end-up in behavior analytics or at user interaction layer (alerts, threat hunting...). All of that being enabled and supported by automation.


### SOC/CSIRT architecture of detection
Based on [CYRAIL's paper drawing](https://slideplayer.com/slide/15779727/), that I've slightly modified, here is an example of architecture of detection (SIEM, SIRP, TIP interconnections) and workflow:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/207597681-22c9da6d-d430-4660-b807-3e86138a0d9c.png)

* Sensors log sources are likely to be: audit logs, security sensors (antimalware, FW, NIDS, proxies, EDR, NDR, CASB, identity threat detection, honeypot...).

# SOAR

## What is SOAR?

As per [Gartner definition](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/08/gartner-soar-magic-quadrant-when-where-and-how/):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/186781422-ebb3996a-da66-4d27-a55f-6065fa84fca5.png)

Hence 3 critical tools (see above): SIRP, TIP, SOA, on top of SIEM.

And in my view, SOAR is more an approach, a vision, based on technology and processes, than a technology or tool per say. 


## Simple and commonly needed automation tools

* Online automated hash checker (script):
  * my recommendation: [Munin](https://github.com/Neo23x0/munin), or with PowerShell [Posh-VT](https://github.com/darkoperator/Posh-VirusTotal)

* Online URL automated analysis:
  * my recommendation: [CyberGordon](https://cybergordon.com/), [URLScan.io](https://urlscan.io/)

* Online automated sample analyzer:
  * my recommendation, via script and without sample submission: [Malwoverview](https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview);
  * my recommendations for online dynamic analysis: [Hybrid-Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/), [Joe's sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/#windows)

* (pure) Windows tasks automation:
  * My recommendations: [AutoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

* SaaS-based (and partly free, for basic stuff) SOA:
  * [Shuffle](https://shuffler.io/)

## Common automations

### My recommendations for detection (alerts handling):

Try to implement at least the following automations, leveraging the SOA/SIRP/TIP/SIEM capabilities:
* Make sure all the context from any alert is being automatically transfered to the SIRP ticket, with a link to the SIEM alert(s) in case of.
  * Leverage API (through SOA) if needed to retrieve the missing context info, when using built-in integrations.
* Automatically query the TIP for any artefacts or even IOC that is associated to a SIRP ticket.
* Automatically retrieve the history of antimalware detections for an user and/or endpoint, that is associated to a SIRP ticket.
* Automatically retrieve the history of SIEM detections for an user and/or endpoint, that is associated to a SIRP ticket.
* Automatically retrieve the history of SIRP tickets for an user and/or endpoint, that is associated to a new SIRP ticket.
* Automatically query AD or the assets management solution, for artefact anrichment (user, endpoint, IP, application, etc.).

### My recommendations for response (incident response, containment/eradication steps):
* Block an IP on all firewalls (including VPN), SWG and CASB.
* Block an URL on SWG. 
* Block an email address (sender) on SEG.
* Block an exe file (by hash) on endpoints (leveraging antimalware/EDR or AppLocker).
* Block an exe file (by hash) on gateways and CASB: SWG, SEG, CASB.
* Reset an AD account password.
* Disable an AD account (both user and computer, since computer account disabling will block authentication with any AD account on the endpoint, thus preventing from lateral movement or priv escalation).
* Report a (undetected) sample to security vendors, via email. Here are a few addresses, in case of: 
  * Files samples (to be attached in a password-protected Zip file, with 'infected' as password): samples@eset.com, newvirus@kaspersky.com, report@sentinelone.com, virus_submission@bitdefender.com, vsamples@f-secure.com, virus_malware@avira.com, submitvirus@fortinet.com, virus_research@avertlabs.com, virus_doctor@trendmicro.com
  * URL/IP samples: samples@eset.com, samples@kaspersky.com, report@sentinelone.com, virus_submission@bitdefender.com, vsamples@f-secure.com, phish@office365.microsoft.com, report@openphish.com, reportphishing@apple.com, abuse@clean-mx.de, datasubmission@mcafee.com
* Report a false positive to security vendors, via email;
  * You may want to have a look at [this page](https://github.com/yaronelh/False-Positive-Center) to know the required email address.
* Report a malicious URL (for instance, phishing) to a security vendor for takedown steps
  * My recommendation: [Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/cybercrime/) [via API](https://report.netcraft.com/api/v3), or [PhishReport](https://phish.report/docs).

# IT achitecture

## Have a single and centralized platform ('single console')

As per [NCSC website](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/building-a-security-operations-centre/detection/detection-practices#section_2):
> Indications of an attack will rarely be isolated events on a single system component or system. So, where possible, having a single platform where analysts have the ability to see and query log data from all of your onboarded systems is invaluable.
> Having access to the log data from multiple (or all) components, will enable analysts to look for evidence of attack across an estate and create detection use-cases that utilise a multitude of sources.
> By creating temporal (actions over a period of time) and spatial (actions across the estate) use-cases, an organisation is better prepared to address cyber security attacks that occur system wide.



## Disconnect (as much as possible) SOC from monitored environment

The goal is to prevent an attacker from achieving lateral movement from a compromised monitored zone, to the SOC/CSIRT work zone.

### Enclave: 
* Implement SOC enclave (with network isolation), as per MITRE paper drawing:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/186420265-4c0275b2-d70e-4fec-936c-712c1c4802a8.png)

* Only log collectors and WEF should be authorized to send data to the SOC/CSIRT enclave. Whenever possible, the SOC tools pull the data from the monitored environment, and not the contrary.

SOC’s assets should be part of a separate [restricted AD forest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/forest-design-models ), to allow AD isolation with the rest of the monitored AD domains. 


### Endpoints hardening:

* SOC/CSIRT's endpoints should be hardened with relevant guidelines;
   * My recommendations: [CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/), [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319)

## SOC sensors, nice to have
* (full featured) Honeypot:
  * My recommendation: [Canary.tools](https://canary.tools/)
* Phishing and brand infringement protection (domain names):
  * My recommendation: [PhishLabs](https://www.phishlabs.com/), [Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/cybercrime/fraud-detection/)
* NDR:
  * My recommendation: [Gatewatcher](https://www.gatewatcher.com/en/our-solutions/trackwatch/)
* MDM:
  * My recommendation: [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune)
* DLP:
  * See [Gartner reviews and ratings](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/data-loss-prevention)
* Network TAP:
  * My recommendation: [Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/products/access-traffic/network-taps.html)


## Management
* **Define SOC priorities, with feared events and offensive scenarios (TTP) to be monitored**, as per risk analysis results.
  * My recommendation: leverage EBIOS RM methodology (see [above](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/README.md#to-go-further)).

* Leverage machine learning, wherever it can be relevant in terms of good ratio false positives / real positives.
  * My recommendation: be careful, try not to saturate SOC consoles with FP.

* Make sure to **follow the 11 strategies for a (world class) SOC**, as per MITRE paper (see [Must Read](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/README.md#must-read)).

* Publish your RFC2350, declaring what your CERT is (see 'Nice to read' [above](https://github.com/cyb3rxp/awesome-soc/blob/main/README.md#to-go-further))


## Harden SOC/CSIRT environment
* Implement hardening measures on SOC workstations, servers, and IT services that are used (if possible).
   * e.g.: [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/), [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319)
* Put the SOC assets in a separate AD forest, as [forest is the AD security boundary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/gathering-information-about-your-active-directory-deployment), for isolation purposes, in case of a global enterprise's IT compromise
* Create/provide a disaster recovery plan for the SOC assets and resources.
* Implement admin bastions and silo to administrate the SOC env (equipments, servers, endpoints):
  * My advice: consider the SOC environment as to be administrated by **Tier 1**, if possible with a dedicated admin bastion. Here is a generic drawing from Wavestone's article (see Must read references): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16035152/202517740-812091b6-ff31-49cd-941e-3f6e4b4d140c.png)
